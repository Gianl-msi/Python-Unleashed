In fact, the use of illegal drugs may be responsible for more than 2 5 % of property crimes and 1 5 % of violent crimes. Financial losses related to these crimes have been estimated at $1.7 billion per year. Homicides are also strongly linked to drug dealing. Approximately 1 4 % of homicides per year are causally related to drugs. The costs for criminal justice activities directed against drug trafficking on the federal level were approximately $2.5 billion in 1988, compared to $1.76 billion spent in 1986. There are also many health problems caused by these drugs. Alcohol can damage almost every body organ, including the heart, brain, liver, and stomach. Illegal drugs such as cocaine can have a serious effect on the neurological, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. Cigarettes can cause cancer, heart disease, and more. The most widely used and abused drug in the world is alcohol. In the United States, two-thirds of the population drink alcohol. About ten out of a hundred people have problems with alcohol so serious that they can be considered \"alcoholic\" or \"alcohol-dependent.\" (Interestingly, this 1 0 % of Americans buys and drinks more than half of the alcoholic beverages!) At least 14 million Americans take illegal drugs every month. Dur­ ing \"peak months\" this number climbs to more than 25 million users. Some experts have estimated that approximately 2.3% of Americans over 12 years of age have a problem with illegal drugs serious enough to warrant drug treatment. To a large degree, we have tried to put a halt to drug abuse by making drugs illegal. For example, heroin and cocaine are presently illegal in the United States. Cigarette smoking is becoming increas­ ingly proscribed. At one time we tried to stop alcoholism by legal Vll via Preface mechanisms (i.e., prohibition). Obviously, these methods will never make substances completely unavailable. Not all people who use drugs become addicted to them, although many people have asked themselves, \"Am I [or is someone else] an alcoholic [or a substance abuser]?\" The American Psychiatric Associ­ ation has defined the addictions very specifically. In fact, the official term for an addiction is \"substance dependence.\" There are some specific signs of substance dependence, including (1) heavy use of the substance, (2) continued use even though it may cause problems to the person, (3) tolerance, and (4) withdrawal symptoms. Cultural and historical factors are implicated in substance use and abuse. The patterns and consequences of drug use have been influ­ enced by historical developments, which have had positive and neg­ ative effects. Two centuries ago, the extraction of pure chemicals from plant materials created more powerful medicinal agents. The inven­ tion of the hypodermic needle in the middle of the nineteenth cen­ tury was also a medical boon, which, on the other hand, allowed drug users to circumvent the body's natural biological controls consisting of bitter taste and slow absorption through the digestive tract. Many synthetic drugs developed in the twentieth century had medical appli­ cation but created further opportunities for abuse and addiction. In short, any activity that affects the reward mechanisms of the brain may lead to compulsive, self-defeating behavior. Social, environmental, and personality factors have affected sub­ stance use and abuse in ways that go far beyond the simple pharma­ cological properties of these agents. Alcoholism, for example, is preva­ lent among certain ethnic groups and practically absent among others, such as the Mormons, who require abstinence for group acceptance. O n the other hand, other social subgroups may condition group accep­ tance on using or drinking. The social milieu may influence using. Soldiers used illegal drugs extensively in Vietnam but, for the most part, relinquished heavy drug use after returning home. Impoverished environments have been shown in both animal experiments and human studies to lead to addiction. As pointed out by Peele, the com­ m o n denominator is the lack of other opportunities for satisfaction. Finally, our clinical experiences have indicated that addicted indi­ viduals have certain clusters of addictive attitudes that make them abusers rather than users. Successful treatment depends on clinicians' effectiveness in deal­ ing with these addictive potentials. And what form will this care take? As pointed out by Marc Galanter, president of the American Academy of Psychiatrists in Alcoholism and Addiction, the long-term efficacy of new pharmacological treatments is open to question. \"Tricyclics, Preface ix dopaminergic agents, and carbamazapine for cocaine abusers have yet to be substantiated as a vehicle for continuing care. For opiates, naltrexone and buprenorphine offer only a modest niche in the do­ main that was traditionally occupied by methadone maintenance. Intervention in GABAergic transmission may hold promise for alco- hoHsm, but that promise is far from clinical application\" (Galanter, 1993, pp. 1-2). W e have written this book in response to the ever-growing need to formulate and test cost-effective treatments for substance abuse dis­ orders, problems that seem to be multiplying in the population in spite of society's best efforts at international interdiction and domes­ tic control and education. W e believe that cognitive therapy, a well- documented and demonstrably efficacious treatment model, can be a major boon to meeting this pressing need. At one time, \"drug abuse rehabilitation counseling\" was regarded as a specialty area in the field of psychotherapy—now it is apparent that almost all who engage in clinical practice will encounter patients who use and abuse drugs. Therefore, it would be desirable for all mental health professionals to receive some sort of routine training and education in the social and psychological phenomena that com­ prise the addiction disorders. Our volume is intended to provide a thorough, detailed set of methods that can be of immediate use to therapists and counselors—regardless of the amount of experience they might have had with cognitive therapy, or in the field of addictions. Toward this end, we have strived to make our model and our proce­ dures as specific and complete as possible. W e certainly recommend that those who read this book also read the many valuable sources we have cited in the text. Nevertheless, our intention in writing Cog­ nitive Therapy of Substance Abuse has been to provide a convenient, centralized source that is comprehensive, teachable, and testable. Although advances in the field have been made in the form of pharmacological interventions (e.g., antabuse, methadone, and nal­ trexone), 12-step support groups (e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous, Nar­ cotics Anonymous, and Cocaine Anonymous), and social-learning models and programs (relapse prevention, rational recovery, etc.), each of these approaches has posed problems that limit its respective poten­ tial efficacy. For example, pharmacological interventions have pro­ duced promising short-term data but are fraught with compliance and long-term maintenance difficultieŝ atients may not take their chem­ ical agonists and antagonists, and they are prone to relapse when the medications are discontinued. Twelve-step programs provide valuable social support and consistent guidance principles for individuals who voluntarily join and faithfully attend the program meetings, but can- X Preface not address the needs of those who will not enter the programs or who drop out. Social-learning approaches provide sophisticated models of substance abuse and relapse, and hold promise to produce and accumulate empirical data, but thus far the resultant treatments (with very few exceptions) have been less well described than the theories that gave rise to them. Although the cognitive approach that we have explicated is most closely related to the social-learning theories of substance abuse, we want to emphasize that we find value in all of the aforementioned treatment modalities. Cognitive therapy is not in \"opposition\" to 12- step or psychobiological models of substance abuse. W e have found that these alternative treatment systems may be complementary to our procedures. Many of the substance abuse patients that we treat at the Center for Cognitive Therapy concurrently attend Narcotics Anony­ mous and similar 12-step groups. Other patients take the full spec­ trum of pharmacologic agents, from antidepressants to antabuse, under strict medical guidance. The individualized conceptualization of patients' belief systems and the long-term coping skills (to deal with everyday life concerns, as well as to manage cravings and urges spe­ cific to drug use) that cognitive therapy provides for patients can mesh well with medication and 12-step meetings. The main variable that seems to influence whether or not patients avail themselves of all of these treatment opportunities (once they have been presented to the patients in a feasible manner) is not the practical compatibility of the treatments, but rather the attitudes of the treatment providers] At present, an earlier draft of this book is serving as a treatment manual in a National Institute on Drug Abuse collaborative, multisite study on the respective efficacy of cognitive therapy, supportive- expressive therapy, and general drug counseling. Data obtained from this project will help us to answer two important questions: (1) Does Cognitive Therapy of Substance Abuse succeed as a manual for the train­ ing of competent cognitive therapists for patients with addictions? and (2) Do patients who receive the treatment outlined in the text make demonstrable and lasting gains? In order to answer these questions, therapists are provided with intensive supervision (note: the authors of this text serve in that role), complete with competency and adher­ ence ratings on a regular basis; treatment is not confounded with adjunct medications, urinalyses are routinely conducted, and a host of measures other than drug monitoring per se are being administered and evaluated (to examine changes in mood and global adaptational functioning). Drug abuse is a sociological problem as well as a psychological issue. Factors such as poverty and lack of adequate educational and Preface xi vocational opportunities play a role in the epidemic. However, we believe that it is harmful to assume that low socioeconomic status patients cannot be treated as effectively as those of higher socioeco­ nomic status. While social change is desirable, individual change is not necessarily dependent on it. W e are optimistic that cognitive ther­ apy can serve as an important individual-focused treatment in today's society, and that the data will support this. A c k n o\n",

They are problems that directly affect those millions of Americans who suffer from substance abuse and indirectly touch the lives of millions more in the larger social and vocational networks around them. One in every ten adults in this country has a serious alcohol problem (Institute of Medicine [lOM], 1987) and at least one in four is addicted to nicotine (Centers for Disease Control [CDC], 1991a). Approximately 1 in 35 Americans over the age of 12 abuses illicit drugs (lOM, 1990a). This level of substance abuse has profound social, medical, and psychological ramifications on both the individual and the larger societal levels. The C D C (1991b), for example, estimate that approximately 434,000 people in this coun­ try die each year as a result of cigarette smoking, and many thou­ sands also die as a result of alcoholism (lOM, 1987) and/or illicit drug abuse (lOM, 1990a). It must be emphasized, however, that substance abuse spans many more areas and the toll taken is far greater than these simple mortality figures convey. In this introductory chapter we set the stage for the cognitive therapy of substance abuse. W e begin with an overview of psycho-v active substances and substance abuse, we briefly review the history of psychoactive substance use, we describe the most commonly used and abused psychoactive substances, we discuss cognitive models for understanding substance abuse and relapse, and we scan traditional methods for treating substance abuse. 2 COGNITIVE THERAPY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE BACKGROUND: PSYCHOACTIVE SUBSTANCES AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE Psychoactive substances are chemicals that affect the central nervous system, altering the user's thoughts, moods, and/or behaviors. The revised third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-lIl-R; American Psychiatric Associa­ tion [APA], 1987) categorizes psychoactive substances into 10 classes: alcohol; amphetamines or similarly acting sympathomimetics; can­ nabis; cocaine; hallucinogens; inhalants; nicotine; opioids; phencycli- dine (PCP) or similarly acting arylcyclohexylamines; and sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics. Each of these substances has unique prop­ erties and effects. Some substances that are abused have low addic­ tive potential (e.g., hallucinogens), while others have high addictive potential (e.g., crack cocaine). Some are typically smoked (e.g., nico­ tine, cannabis, and crack cocaine); others are ingested orally (e.g., hallucinogens and sedatives); while still others are taken intranasally (e.g., powdered cocaine and inhalants). Some drugs lead the user to feel \"up\" or energized (e.g., amphetamines and cocaine); some cause the user to feel \"down\" or relaxed (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics); while others (e.g, alcohol and nicotine) simultaneously have both effects on the user. DSM-III-R distinguishes between substance abuse and dependence. Abuse is defined as a maladaptive pattern of psychoactive substance use while dependence (considered more serious than abuse) is defined as \"impaired control of use\" (i.e., physiological addiction). In this volume, we do not go to great lengths to emphasize this distinction. Instead, we view any pattern of psychoactive substance use as prob­ lematic and requiring intervention if it results in adverse social, voca­ tional, legal, medical, or interpersonal consequences, regardless of whether the abuser experiences physiological tolerance or withdrawal. Further, although we caution against an all-or-none view of addic­ tion and recovery, and although we acknowledge that some patients seem to be more successful at engaging in controlled, moderate sub­ stance use than are others, we advocate a program of treatment that strives for abstinence. In this manner we maximize the patients' chances of maintaining an able and responsible lifestyle, reduce the risk of relapse, and avoid giving patients the false impression that we view a mere reduction in drug use as the optimal outcome. History of Psychoactive Substance Use Psychoactive substances have been used by most cul­ tures since prehistoric times (Westermeyer, 1991). In fact, for centuries Overview 3 psychoactive substances have served many individual and social func tions. O n an individual level, they have provided stimulation, relief from adverse emotional states and uncomfortable physical symptoms, and altered states of consciousness. O n a social level, psychoactive substances have facilitated religious rituals, ceremonies, and medical functions. Egyptian and Chinese opiate use was evident from the earliest writings of these people (Westermeyer, 1991). Marijuana was referenced in India \"as far back as the second millennium B.C.\" (Brecher, 1972, p. 397). Evidence of Mayan, Aztec, and Incan medici­ nal and ritual drug use was evident from their statues and from draw­ ings on their buildings and pottery (Karan, Haller, & SchnoU, 1991; Westermeyer, 1991). Alcohol use goes back to paleolithic times (Good­ win, 1981) and Mesopotamian civilization gave one of the earliest clinical descriptions of intoxication and hangover cures. In modern times the World Health Organization (WHO) has been concerned about drug and alcohol abuse problems on a worldwide scale (Grant, 1986). As early as 1968 the W H O conducted an interna­ tional study of drug use in youth (Cameron, 1968), and in a more recent study (Smart, Murray, & Arif, 1988) drug abuse and preven­ tion programs in 29 countries were reviewed. However, Smart and his colleagues concluded from their review that \"the seriousness of the drug problem is well recognized in some countries but not in oth­ ers\" (p. 16). Presently the W H O is addressing the issue of alcohol- related problems by developing an international secondary preven­ tion protocol (Babor, Korner, Wilber, & Good, 1987). Drug policies in the United States have been profoundly affected by historical and sociocultural attitudes regarding psychoactive drugs on a spectrum from less restrictive (e.g., libertarian) to more restrictive (i.e., criminal). Between the late 1700s and the late 1800s, for example, psychoactive dnigs (especially narcotics) were widely used in the United States. In fact, Musto (1991) reported that opium and cocaine were legally available during this time from \"the local dmggist.\" A Consumers Union report (Brecher, 1972) described the nineteenth century as \"a dope fiend's paradise\" due to such minimal restrictions. In the late 1800s and the early 1900s, medical conceptualizations of addiction began to develop, however, influenced to some extent by Dr. Benjamin Rush's (1790) ear­ lier interest in the course of addictions. Magnus Huss, a Swedish physi­ cian, first used the term \"alcoholism\" in 1849 (lOM, 1990b). At the same time (late 1800s and early 1900s), criminalization of drug use was m- creasingly becoming U.S. policy. In the 1960s and 1970s, however, atti­ tudes about drugs became less restrictive as U.S. sociopolitical attitudes generally became more liberal. Simultaneously, the disease model of addictions was gaining widespread acceptance, partly due to the work ofjellinek(1960). 4 COGNITIVE THERAPY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE Since the 1980s, the United States has again become less toler­ ant and more restrictive about drugs. At least two explanations can account for this phenomenon: (1) The negative effects of drugs on individuals, families, and society have become more apparent with increased use, and (2) sociopolitical attitudes in the United States generally have become more conservative. At the same time, however, there is increasing controversy about the disease model of addiction (\"Current Disease model,\" 1992; Fingarette, 1988; Peele & Brodsky, with Arnold, 1991) and the criminalization of psychoactive substances (R. L. Miller, 1991). The Most Commonly Used Drugs Alcohol Alcohol is simultaneously a chemical, a beverage, and a drug that \"powerfully modifies the functioning of the nervous sys­ tem\" (Levin, 1990, p. 1). Approximately 1 0 % of Americans in the United States have a serious drinking problem; 6 0 % are light to mod­ erate drinkers; and the remaining 3 0 % of adults in the United States do not consume any alcohol. Alcohol abuse, however, accounts for approximately 8 1 % of hospitalizations for substance abuse disorders (lOM, 1987). Remarkably, half the alcohol consumed in this country is consumed by the 1 0 % who are heavy drinkers. A larger percentage of men than women drink and a greater percentage of men than women are heavy drinkers. Alcohol initially acts as a general anesthetic, interfering with subtle functions of thought, reason, and judgment (Miller & Munoz, 1976). As blood alcohol concentration (BAC) increases, however, the effects become more intense until gross motor functioning is also affected. At still higher BAC levels, sleep is induced, and ultimately death may occur as a result of respiratory depression. \"Alcohol affects almost every organ system in the body either directly or indirectly\" (National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alco­ holism [NIAAA], 1990, p. 107). Thus with chronic use, alcohol can cause serious multiple medical problems, including damage to the liver, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, cardiovascular system, immune system, endocrine system, and nervous system. Alcohol has also been strongly linked to the leading causes of accidental death in the United States: motor vehicle accident, falls, and fire-related injuries. Further­ more, approximately 3 0 % of suicides and half of all homicides are alcohol related (lOM, 1987), and estimates of annual deaths related to alcohol use range between 69,000 and 200,000 per year (lOM, Overview 5 1987). In addition, a significant percentage of both violent and non violent crimes are committed under the influence of alcohol (cf. McCord, 1992). Chronic alcohol use can also have other profound negative social consequences, including loss of career, friends, and family. A great deal of physical and sexual abuse, for example, is related to the intoxicated state of the offender (Clayton, 1992; Frances & Miller, 1991; Harstone & Hansen, 1984), and general family dys­ function often is associated with the alcoholism of one or more adult members (Heath & Stanton, 1991). Medical complications can even reach insidiously into the next generation, in that maternal drinking during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol syndrome and other seri­ ous birth defects. In fact, \"prenatal alcohol exposure is one of the leading known causes of mental retardation in the western world\" (NIAAA, 1990, p. 139). Illicit Drugs According to the lOM (1990a), at least 14 million persons consume illicit drugs monthly. During peak months this fig­ ures climbs to more than 25 million users. It is estimated that approxi­ mately 2.3% of the U.S. population over 12 years old has an illicit drug problem sufficiently serious to warrant treatment. This statistic is substantially higher, however, for individuals who are incarcerated (33%) or on parole or probation (25%). W h e n these people are included in the epidemiologic data, the estimate of illicit drug use problems in the overall population increases to 2.7%. Regarding\n",

      "the social costs of illicit drug abuse, it is estimated that more than 2 5 % of property crimes and 1 5 % of violent crimes are related to illicit drug use by the criminal. Financial losses related to these crimes have been estimated at $1.7 billion per year. Homicides are also strongly linked to activities surrounding drug dealing. Approx­ imately 1 4 % of homicides per year are causally related to drugs. The costs for criminal justice activities directed against drug trafficking on the federal level were approximately $2.5 billion in 1988, com­ pared to $1.76 billion spent in 1986. In the following sections we present brief descriptions of the three most commonly used illicit drugs: marijuana, cocaine, and the opioids. In 1972, a Consumers Union report identified marijuana as the fourth most popular psychoactive drug in the world, after caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol (Brecher, 1972, p. 402). Although marijuanas use has declined since its peak in 1979, it still remains the most widely used illicit drug in Western society (APA, 1987; Weiss & Millman, 1991). 6 COGNITIVE THERAPY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE Marijuana is typically smoked, although it can also be ingested. According to Weiss and Millman (1991), in spite of its generally sedat­ ing effects, marijuana's psychoactive effects in the user are quite varied, \"profoundly dependent upon the personality of the user, his or her expectation, and the setting\" (p. 160). The health effects of marijuana have been widely debated and remain quite controversial, probably due to the inconsistent effects of the drug on the individual user and across different users. For some time marijuana was considered relatively safe and nonaddictive (Brecher, 1972). Presently, however, it is associated with multiple adverse physical and psychological effects, including labile affect and depression, amotivational syndrome, impaired short-term memory, and pulmonary disease (Weiss & Millman, 1991). According to DSM- III-R, marijuana dependence is characterized by heavy use of the drug (e.g., daily) with substantial impairment. Marijuana dependence also puts one at risk for other psychological problems, as those who are dependent on cannabis are also likely polysubstance abusers or afflicted with other psychiatric disorders (APA, 1987; Weiss & Millman, 1991). Cocaine is a major central nervous system stimulant that produces euphoria, alertness, and a sense of well-being. It may also lower anxi­ ety and social inhibitions while increasing energy, self-esteem, and sexuality. Presently cocaine is among the most widely used illicit drugs. In fact, cocaine use increased in 1991, \"despite the Bush adminis­ tration's three-year war against drugs\" (Mental Health Report, 1992, p. 5). Clearly, for many people the positive short-term physiological and psychological effects of cocaine maladaptively supersede the dan­ gers associated with acquiring and using the drug. According to Gawin and EUinwood (1988), \"The pursuit of this direct, pharmacologically based euphoria becomes so dominant that the user is apt to ignore signs of mounting personal disaster\" (p. 1174). Cocaine is an alkaloid (as are caffeine and nicotine) which is extracted from the coca leaf. In its pure form, raw coca leaves can be chewed, although this practice is generally limited to native popula­ tions in the cocaine-producing countries (APA, 1987). In the United States, cocaine is most commonly taken intrana­ sally (i.e., snorted or \"tooted\") in the powder form of cocaine hydro­ chloride. In this form, the user pours the powder on a hard surface and then arranges it into \"lines,\" one of which is snorted into each nostril (Karan et al., 1991). In powdered form, cocaine hydrochloride can also be mixed with water and administered by intravenous injec­ tion. This process is known as \"shooting\" or \"mainlining\" (Karan et al., 1991). Intravenous injection of cocaine results in intense sub­ jective and physiologic effects within 30 seconds Oones, 1987). Overview 7 Cocaine can also be smoked as a paste or in alkaloid form (i.e., \"freebased\"). In this form it also produces its effects within seconds. Crack cocaine (named for the sound made by the cocaine as it is freebased) is the currently popular form of freebase which is sold in relatively inexpensive, prepackaged, and ready-to-use small doses (Karan et al., 1991). According to Karan et al. (1991), low-cost crack, approximately $2-$ 10 per vial, \"has been widely available on the streets in many American cities since 1985\" (p. 125), making it easily within the financial grasp of most teenagers and even the impover­ ished. Adding to this high availability is the especially troublesome fact that crack cocaine produces an enormously intense and almost instant high. Crack cocaine is, therefore, extremely addictive, lead­ ing to significant impairment in life functioning after only a few weeks' use on average (Gawin & EUinwood, 1988; Smart, 1991), much faster than, for example, intranasal usage of cocaine. These charac­ teristics of crack cocaine make it especially prone to rapid increase in the prevalence of its abuse. Indeed, many observers suggest that cocaine use has already reached epidemic levels (Weinstein, Gottheil, & Sterling, 1992). In the popular press, for example, a graphic biographical Reader's Digest article describes cocaine as \"the devil within\" (Ola & D'Aulaire, 1991). This contrasts starkly with the glorification of cocaine in movies and songs of the 1970s and early 1980s, when cocaine was seen as the drug of choice of the affluent and powerful. In the scientific litera­ ture, Gawin and EUinwood (1988) explain that \"believing that the drug was safe, millions of people tried cocaine, and cocaine abuse exploded\" (p. 1173). These authors report that 1 5 % of Americans have tried cocaine, and 3 million people had abused cocaine regularly by 1986, resulting in \"more than five times the number addicted to heroin\" (p. 1173). Smart and Adlaf (1990) report also that an increasing num­ ber of cocaine abusers have sought treatment since the 1980s. Cohen (1991) attributes the \"cocaine outbreak\" to supply factors (e.g., low cost, availability, and high profitability), external factors (e.g., peer pressure and media portrayals of drug usage), internal factors (e.g., hedonism, sociopathy, depression, and life stress), and intrinsic drug factors (e.g., \"the pharmacologic imperative\"). Strikingly, cocaine abuse occurs and persists in spite of dramatic medical problems that are associated with its use: central nervous system damage, cardiac arrest, stroke, respiratory collapse, severe hypertension, exacerbation of chronic diseases, infection, and psychiatric complications (Estroff, 1987). Because cocaine abuse research has produced fewer pharma­ cological treatment alternatives than has research on some other illicit drugs such as heroin (Alterman, O'Brien, & McLellan, 1991; Covi, Baker, & Hess, 1990; Stine, 1992), and because of the extent and 8 COGNITIVE THERAPY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE severity of cocaine-related problems, we have placed proportionatel greater emphasis on cocaine and crack cocaine than on other drugs in this treatment manual. The opioids, including heroin, methadone, and codeine, are drugs that pharmacologically resemble morphine. Drugs in this class pro­ duce feelings of euphoria, relaxation, and mood elevation. They also have the potential for reducing pain, anxiety, aggression, and sexual drives (lOM, 1990a), and are considered highly addictive. According to Thomason and Dilts (1991): Opioids have the capacity to commandeer all of an individual's attention, resources, and energy, and to focus these exclusively on obtaining the next dose at any cost. This vicious cycle repeats itself every few hours, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, for years on end. Comprehending the implications of opioid abuse shocks and stag­ gers the inquiring mind. (p. 103) Although the use of pharmacologic agonists such as methadone (and antagonists such as naltrexone) traditionally has represented an important component of treatment in the heroin abuser, methadone itself is unfortunately subject to various forms of abuse (e.g., black market dealings or use with other drugs). Further, many heroin abusers find methadone to be inferior to the \"real stuff,\" leading to high noncompliance and dropout (Grabowski, Stitzer, & Henningfield, 1984) rates with these programs. Therefore, we posit that pharmaco­ logic approaches (even for heroin) represent an incomplete treatment strategy unless utilized in combination with psychosocial approaches such as support groups and cognitive therapy. Nicotine Cigarette smoking is by far the single most prevent­ able cause of death in the United States. In fact, it has been estimated that 434,000 people died in 1988 due to cigarette smoking (CDC, 1991b). This figure includes those who died of cancer, lung disease, heart disease, house fires caused by careless smoking, and renal and pancreatic disease. Approximately 49.4 million Americans (28.1%) are regular cigarette smokers (CDC, 1991a), despite the fact that cigarette smoking is known to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this country. Since the mid-1970s, however, the number of smokers has admit­ tedly decreased steadily. Historically, more men than women have smoked; however, a higher proportion of men than women have also quit smoking. It has thus been projected that by the year 1995, more Overview 9 women than men will be smokers. Ironically, in spite of cigarettes' historical and advertising linkage with status, wealth, and desirabil­ ity, it is increasingly the case that the socially disadvantaged are over- represented as smokers. The number of minorities, poor, and less educated people who smoke, for example, has been disproportionately higher than those who do not smoke, and this trend is expected to continue (Pierce, Flore, & Novotny, 1989). Nicotine is the psychopharmacologically addictive ingredient in cigarettes. As mentioned earlier, nicotine dependence is included in DSM-III-R, along with the dependence on other psychoactive sub­ stances (alcohol, opiates, cocaine, etc.). Not surprisingly, we have found the addictive process in cigarette smoking to be analogous to the addictive process involved in the other psychoactive substances. Therefore, although nicotine addiction is not associated with the same degree of social, vocational, and legal consequences as is addiction to illicit drugs, its medical hazards and the fact that early-life regular smoking often leads to addiction to \"harder\" substances (Henning­ field, Clayton, & Pollin, 1990) make it an important area for mental health intervention. Although this volume focuses relatively little on methods specifically geared to smoking cessation, we believe that the same principles of assessment and treatment (e.g., coping with crav­ ings and modifying beliefs) that we outline in this book are highly applicable to the patient addicted to nicotine. Polysubstance Abuse Individuals abusing one psychoactive substance are likely to be simultaneously abusing another substance. In fact, between 2 0 % and 3 0 % of alcoholics in the general public and approxi­ mately 8 0 % in treatment programs are dependent on at least one other drug. A prevalent combination is alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine (N. S. Miller, 1991, p. 198). N S Miller (1991) explains that polysubstance abuse occurs tor multiple reasons. For example, some drugs enhance the effects of other drugs, while some drugs are used to avoid unwanted side effects of other drugs. Some drugs are used to treat drug withdrawal effects of other drugs and, similarly, some drugs are used as substihites for other '^'\"^The medical and psychological correlates of polysubstance abus are numerous (N. S. Miller, 1991). They include problems associated with each individual drug (e.g., liver and heart disease associated with alcohol abuse), as well as those more commonly associated with multiple substances (e.g., interaction-induced overdose). 10 COGNITIVE THERAPY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE Dual Diagnosis: Substance Abuse and Other Psychiatric Disorders The coexistence of substance abuse with other psy­ chiatric disorders is also very common (e.g., Ananth et al., 1989; Brown, Ridgely, Pepper, Levine, & Ryglewicz, 1989; Bunt, Galanter, Lifshutz, & Castaneda, 1990; Davis, 1984; Hesselbrock, Meyer, & Kenner, 1985; Kranzler & Liebowitz, 1988; Nace, Saxon, & Shore, 1986; Nathan, 1988; Penick et al., 1984; Regier et al., 1990; Ross, Glaser, & Germanson, 1988; Schneier & Siris, 1987). In a survey of more than 20,000 Americans conducted by Regier et al. (1990) it was found that individuals with psychiatric disorders were 2.7 times as likely to have alcohol or other drug problems, compared to those without psychi­ atric disorders. In fact, 3 7 % of individuals with substance use disor­ ders had coexisting Axis I mental disorders. From these data it appears that individuals with substance abuse problems should benefit most from therapeutic interventions that simultaneously address their other psychiatric disorders. Cognitive therapy is ideally suited for these individuals, since it has been devel­ oped and tested on patients with depression, anxiety, and personal­ ity disorders (see Hollon & Beck, in press, for a most recent compre­ hensive review).\n",

      "In fact, an important component of cognitive therapy involves the case conceptualization (Persons, 1989), defined as the evaluation and integration of historical information, psychiatric diag­ nosis, cognitive profile, and other aspects of functioning (see Chap­ ter 5, this volume, for a detailed description of the case conceptual­ ization). When a coexisting psychiatric syndrome is found to exist with a dmg or alcohol abuse patient, for example, the therapist focuses simultaneously on substance abuse and the symptoms of the psychi­ atric syndrome as well as on any factors of interaction (see Chapters 14, 15, and 16, this volume, for more on the treatment of patients with dual diagnoses). RELAPSE P R E V E N T I O N Substance abuse and dependence are characterized both by remission and by relapse. In a classic review by Hunt, Barnett, and Branch (1971) it was found that heroin, nicotine, and alcohol were all associated with similar high rates and patterns of relapse (p. 455; see Figure 1.1). These investigators found that two-thirds of individuals treated had relapsed within 3 months. Many investigators have speculated about the meaning of these findings, most inferring Overview 11 RELAPSE RATE OVER TIME •----•HEROIN ASMOKING OALCOHOL 2weeksJ 6 101112 MONTHS FIGURE 1.1.

Reprinted by permission. that they reflect common processes that underlie the addictions. In fact, since the publication of Hunt et al.'s (1971) data, addiction experts have focused on developing and testing comprehensive models of addiction that include all the psychoactive substances, as well as gambling and binge eating. Marlatt and his colleagues (Brownell, Marlatt, Lichtenstein, & Wilson, 1986; Marlatt, 1978; Marlatt, 1982; Marlatt & Gordon, 1985) have made an important contribution to the addiction literature with their cognitive-behavioral model of relapse prevention. According to Marlatt and Gordon's (1985) model (see Figure 1.2), individuals view themselves as having a sense of perceived control or self-efficacy. When they are faced with high-risk situations, this sense is threat­ ened. High-risk situations for the drug abuse patient might include negative or positive emotional or physical states, interpersonal con­ flicts, social pressure, or exposure to drug cues. Individuals faced with high-risk situations must respond with coping responses. Those who have effective coping responses develop increased self-efficacy, result­ ing in a decreased probabiHty of relapse. Those who have relatively fewer coping responses or none at all may experience decreased self- 12 COGNITIVE THERAPY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE Coping Increased Decreased response self-efficacy probability of relapse Higii-risk situation Decreased Abstinence self-efficacy violation No Initial effect: Increased coping Positive use of probability response outcome substance Dissonance conflict of expectancies and relapse (for initial self-attribution effects of (guilt and perceived substance) loss of control) F I G U R E 1.2.

This initial use mi g h t result in w h a t Marlatt calls a n Abstinence Violation Effect (AVE; i.e., perceived loss of control) and a n ultimately increased probability of relapse. T h e w o r k of Marlatt and his colleagues has h a d a profound effect o n knowledge about addictive behaviors. In fact, m o s t current text­ books o n addictions n o w deal with the issue of relapse prevention in some way. Although most of the work on relapse prevention has been generated within the cognitive-behavioral model (e.g., Chiauzzi, 1991), various 12-step programs (e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous) and other advocates of the disease model have recently also increased their emphasis on relapse prevention (e.g., Gorski & Miller, 1986). MODELS OF ADDICTION Numerous theoretical models have been developed to explain addictive behaviors (see Baker, 1988; Blane & Leonard, 1987, for recent reviews). As previously mentioned, the dominant trend Overview 13 among addiction experts is toward developing comprehensive theo­ retical models that explain all addictions. Cognitive Models of Addiction A variety of related cognitive models of addiction have been developed and evaluated (e.g., Abrams & Niaura, 1987; Marlatt, 1978, 1985; McDermut, Haaga, & Shayne, 1991; Stacy, Newcomb, & Bentler, 1991; Tiffany, 1990; Wilson, 1987a, 1987b) since Bandura's (1969, 1977) classic presentations of cognitive social learning theory. Marlatt (1985) describes four cognitive processes related to addictions that reflect the cognitive models: self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, attributions of causality, and decision-making processes. Self-efficacy refers to one's judgment about one's ability to deal com­ petently with challenging or high-risk situations. Examples of high self-efficacy beliefs include the following: \"1 can effectively cope with temptations to use drugs\" or \"1 can say 'no' to drugs.\" Examples of low self-efficacy beliefs might include the following: \"I'm a slave to drugs,\" \"I can't get through the day without drugs,\" or \"I can't get what I want, so I might as well use drugs.\" Marlatt (1985) explains that low levels of self-efficacy are associated with relapse and high levels of self-efficacy are associated with abstinence. Marlatt (1985) also explains that self-efficacy increases as a function of success; to the extent that individuals effectively choose not to use drugs, they will experience an increased sense of self-efficacy, for example, believ­ ing that their sense of pride is greater than their need for a \"high.\" Outcome expectancies refer to an individual's anticipation about the effects of an addictive substance or activity. Positive outcome expectancies might include the following beliefs: \"It will feel great to party tonight,\" or \"I won't feel so tense if I use.\" To the extent that one expects a greater positive than negative outcome from using drugs, one is likely to continue using. Attributions of causality refer to an individual's belief that drug use is attributable to internal or external factors. For example, an individual might believe the following: \"Anybody who lives in m y neighborhood would be a drug user\" (external factor), or \"I am physi­ cally addicted to alcohol and m y body can't survive without it\" (inter­ nal factor). Marlatt (1985) explains that such beliefs most likely would result in continued substance use, since the individual perceives his/ her use to be predestined and out of control. For example, the AVE is an individual's tendency to believe that he/she is unable to control substance use after an initial lapse. That is, the AVE occurs when an individual has had a \"lapse\" or \"slip\" (i.e., has used a drug after being 14 COGNITIVE THERAPY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE abstinent for some time) and attributes this lapse to a \"lack of w power\" (i.e., an internal causal factor). Under such circumstances, this individual is likely to continue using, resulting in a full-blown relapse. This is analogous to Beck's (1976) description of all-or-none think­ ing; for example, \"I've blown it, so I might as well keep using.\" Marlatt (1985) also describes substance abuse and relapse as a cognitive decision-making process. He demonstrates (with an amus­ ing example) that substance use is a result of multiple decisions (like forks in the road) which, depending on the decisions, may or may not lead to further substance use. He further explains that some deci­ sions initially appear to be irrelevant to substance use (\"apparently irrelevant decisions\"); however, these decisions ultimately may result in a greater likelihood of relapse because of their incremental push toward higher-risk situations. In his example, Marlatt \"innocently\" chooses to sit in the smoking section of an airplane after being absti­ nent from smoking for several months. As a result of this decision he is more vulnerable to relapse (by his exposure to other smokers, their smoke, and their offers of cigarettes to him). W e see this same phenomenon in patients who claim to have had every intention of remaining abstinent from alcohol and illicit drugs, only to bhthely accept an invitation to meet a friend at a local tavern, or to cavalierly choose to drive out of the way in order to go past a street corner where drugs are sold. When such patients lapse into alcohol and drug use, it is striking to see how they fail to realize the ways in which they set themselves up for a fall with their decisions that lead up to the actual using incident. Unfortunately, the cognitive models of substance abuse have not been integrated adequately into many addiction treatment programs (lOM, 1990a; Miller & Hester, 1985). This volume provides a focused, step-by-step treatment based on Beck's (1976) cognitive model. It is our hope that the chapters that follow will stimulate increased appli­ cation of this cognitive model to substance abuse treatment across treatment settings and modalities. The Motivation to Change Efforts to examine the treatment of addictions are incomplete without considering the issue of motivation. Miller and Rollnick (1991) address this issue, explaining that most addicts are genuinely ambivalent about changing (rather than resistant, weak- willed, or characterologically flawed). The authors view motivation as a \"state of readiness or eagerness to change, which may fluctuate from one time or situation to another\" (p. 14). Overview 15 Prochaska, DiClemente, and Norcross (1992) provide a compre­ hensive model for conceptualizing patients' motivation for change. In their work, Prochaska et al. (1992) identify five stages of change: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and mainte­ nance. In the precontemplation stage, individuals are least concerned with overcoming their problems and they are least motivated to change problematic behaviors. In the contemplation stage individuals are willing to examine the problems associated with their substance use and consider the implications of change, although they may not take any constructive action. They are also likely to respond more positively to confrontation and education, although they may still be ambivalent. In the preparation stage, patients wish to make actual changes and therefore desire help with their problems, although they may feel at a loss as to how to do what is necessary to become drug free. In the action stage individuals have made a commitment to change and they have begun to actually modify behaviors. Prochaska et al. (1992) point out that this is a particularly stressful stage, which may require considerable therapist support and encouragement. In the maintenance stage individuals attempt to continue the process begun in the contemplation and action stages. In recent years, with so much emphasis placed on relapse prevention, the maintenance stage has received increased attention. Prochaska and DiClemente (1986) caution that the process of change is very complex. They explain that \"most individuals do not progress linearly through the stages of change\" (p. 5). Alternatively, they offer a \"revolving door model\" (p. 6), based on the assumption that individuals make multiple revolutions around the circle of stages prior to achieving their long-term goals. Furthermore, they observe that some individuals \"get stuck\" in the earlier stages of change. In the words of Prochaska and DiClemente (1986), \"Therapy with addictive behaviors can progress most smoothly if both the client and the therapist are focusing on the same stage of change\" (p. 6). To use nicotine dependence as an example, a smoker in the precontemplation stage will benefit little from advice about specific strategies for quit­ ting smoking. The same smoker, however, might respond well to general questions about health maintenance, which might lead to a discussion of the health effects of smoking, which might lead further to a discussion of the benefits of quitting, which eventually might lead to a discussion of specific strategies. It is clear that the field can benefit from an understanding of what makes a patient ready to seek help (Tucker & Sobell, 1992). The Prochaska et al. (1992) stage model is a useful heuristic. However, it is important to note that patients in a precontemplative 16 COGNITIVE THERAPY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE Stage of change are not impossible to treat (especially if they ar court order to attend therapy). Conversely, patients in the action phase or maintenance phases are not guaranteed to succeed in treatment. The same degrees of vigilance and commitment are required of the cognitive therapist regardless of the substance abuse patient's stage of change. Treatment Outcome Goals Some models of addiction (e.g., Alcoholics Anony­\n",
      "Number of chars in chunk: 13154\n",
      "-----\n",
      "mous and other disease-model programs) view total abstinence as the only acceptable goal of treatment. Proponents of these models view addiction as an all-or-nothing phenomenon, with any use seen as pathological and abstinence considered a state of \"recovering\" (rather than \"recovered\"). Alternatively, proponents of cognitive-behavioral models are more likely to view light or moderate use (i.e., \"controlled drinking\") as an acceptable goal of treatment in some cases. At one time controlled drinking was extremely controversial (Marlatt, 1983). Presently, however, it is generally accepted that the goals of treatment should vary according to the patient's needs, prob­ lems, and previous response to treatment. Sobell, Sobell, Bogardis, Leo, and Skinner (1992), for example, surveyed problem drinkers to deter­ mine their preference for self-selected versus therapist-selected treat­ ment goals (e.g., abstinence vs. controlled drinking). They found that most respondents preferred setting their own goals and believed that they would be more likely to achieve them; respondents with more serious drinking problems were even more likely to favor self-set goals. In general, we favor a collaborative approach in setting goals with patients. Therefore, to the extent that allowing severely addicted patients to set the modest goal of substance use reduction succeeds in getting otherwise resistant patients engaged in a more complete course of therapy, we are in favor of a controlled substance use approach. In the long run, however, we strongly advocate assisting patients in becoming drug- and alcohol-free. THE TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE A N D DEPENDENCE In reality, most substance abuse treatment programs are eclectic in theory and practice, and they include varying degrees of inpatient and outpatient services, 12-step program attendance, education, psychotherapy, family therapy, support groups, pharmaco- Overview 17 therapy, and so forth. In our view, cognitive therapy can be compat ible with any of these approaches. In fact, many of our drug and alcohol abuse patients attend support groups, have had inpatient detoxification, and take medication. The special strengths that cog­ nitive therapy adds to this battery of approaches are its emphasis on (1) the identification and modification of beliefs that exacerbate crav­ ings, (2) the amelioration of negative affective states (e.g., anger, anxi­ ety, and hopelessness) that often trigger drug use, (3) teaching patients to apply a battery of cognitive and behavioral skills and techniques, and not just willpower, to become and remain drug-free, and (4) help­ ing patients to go beyond abstinence to make fundamental positive changes in the ways they view themselves, their life, and their future, thus leading to new lifestyles. In the following section we present a brief overview of more tra­ ditional treatments of substance abuse and dependence. Alcoholism Treatment Miller and Hester (1980, 1986) have conducted exhaustive reviews of the alcoholism treatment literature. These authors have examined nine major classes of interventions. The four most common were pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy or counseling. Alcoholics Anonymous, and alcoholism education. The five less com­ monly employed approaches included family therapy, aversion thera­ pies, operant methods, controlled drinking, and broad spectrum treat­ ment. Miller and Hester (1986) conclude from their reviews that alco­ holism treatment is best approached as a two-stage process, requir­ ing different interventions at each stage. The first set of interventions should be focused on changing drinking behaviors to abstinence or moderation (e.g., behavioral self-control training). The second set of interventions should be focused on maintenance of sobriety (e.g., social skills training in order to increase confidence in relating to drug- free people). Miller and Hester (1986) also draw some disturbing conclusions, however, about the poor relationship between empirical research and traditional inpatient treatment approaches. Treatment methods that are supported by controlled research include aversion therapies, behav­ ioral self-control training, community reinforcement, marital and family therapy, social skills training, and stress management, whereas approaches actually currently employed as standard practice in alco­ holism programs include Alcoholics Anonymous, alcoholism educa­ tion, confrontation, disulfiram, group therapy, and individual coun- 18 COGNITIVE THERAPY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE seling. They point out that there is little apparent overlap betwe these lists: Alcoholism treatment programs in the United States do not tend to use treatment methods that have been validated by controlled outcome studies. Furthermore, Miller and Hester (1986) point out that traditional inpatient treatment programs are very expensive, \"despite clear evidence that they offer no advantage in overall effectiveness\" (p. 163). Concurring in this, McLellan et al. (1992) note that stan­ dard detoxification and \"28-day programs\" (in spite of their high costs) are insufficient to deal with long-term issues. Clearly, to help drug and alcohol patients deal with more enduring issues, these treat­ ments need to be supplemented with ongoing outpatient treatment that focuses on attitude change and skills acquisition. The Institute of Medicine recently commissioned a National Acad­ emy of Sciences committee to make an exhaustive critical review of the research literature on treatment for alcohol problems (1990b). The committee discovered that interventions included \"a broad range of activities that vary in content, duration, intensity, goals, setting, pro­ vider, and target population\" (p. 86). The committee's assessment was that \"no single treatment approach or modality has been demonstrated to be superior to all others\" (p. 86). Its conclusions, published in Broadening the Base of Treatment for Alcohol Problems (1990a), included the following: 1. There is no single treatment approach that is effective for all persons with alcohol problems. 2. The provision of appropriate, specific treatment modalities can substantially improve outcome. 3. Brief interventions can be quite effective compared with no treatment, and they can be quite cost-effective compared with more intensive treatment. 4. Treatment of other life problems related to drinking can improve outcome in persons with alcohol problems. 5. Therapist characteristics are partial determinants of outcome. 6. Outcomes are determined in part by treatment process factors, posttreatment adjustment factors, the characteristics of indi­ viduals seeking treatment, the characteristics of their problems, and the interactions among these factors. 7. People who are treated for alcohol problems achieve a con­ tinuum of outcomes with respect to drinking behavior and alcohol problems and follow different courses of outcome. 8. Those who significantly reduce their level of alcohol consump­ tion or who become totally abstinent usually enjoy improve­ ment in other life areas, particularly as the period of reduced consumpfion becomes more extended (pp. 147-148). Overview 19 The findings of the Institute of Medicine (1990a) coupled with those of Miller and Hester (1986) make it apparent that there is still a profound need for effective alcoholism treatment interventions. It is hoped that the principles introduced in this text will be integrated into, and evaluated in, traditional treatment programs in order to move toward more effective and appropriate alcoholism treatment programs. Illicit Drug Treatment In addition to its report on alcohol treatment pro­ grams, the Institute of Medicine appointed a separate committee (1990a) to review the treatment of drug problems in the United States. Specifically, the committee divided treatments into four classifications: methadone maintenance, therapeutic communities, outpatient non- methadone programs, and chemical dependency programs. These findings (1990a) were similar to those of Miller and Hester (1986). The most empirically validated programs have been metha­ done maintenance clinics for opioid dependency. Some evidence also supported the efficacy of therapeutic communities and outpatient nonmethadone treatment. Nonetheless, \"Chemical dependency is the treatment with the highest revenues, probably the second largest number of clients, and the smallest scientific basis for assessing its effectiveness\" (lOM, 1990a, p. 18). The Institute of Medicine acknowl­ edges that most of the studies on methadone maintenance were con­ ducted in the 1970s and early 1980s, however. As a result, research has insufficiently addressed the growing cocaine problems in this country. By contrast, this volume will focus heavily on the cognitive therapy of cocaine and crack cocaine addiction. Smoking Cessation Interventions In a report published by the National Cancer Insti­ tute, Schwartz (1987) critically reviewed the literature on smoking cessation interventions. He divided the various methods into 10 cate­ gories: (1) self-care, (2) educational approaches/groups, (3) medica- fion, (4) nicotine chewing gum, (5) hypnosis, (6) acupuncture, (7) physician counseling, (8) risk factor preventive trials, (9) mass media and community programs, and (10) behavioral methods. Schwartz (1987) found considerable variability in cessation rates among these methods. Approximately 1 million Americans per year quit smoking, and most do so on their own through \"self-care.\" In fact, three-fifths of all smokers would prefer to quit on their own, rather than seek group 20 COGNITIVE THERAPY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE quit-smoking programs (Schwartz, 1987). There are many self-help aids for those wishing to quit smoking, including books, pamphlets, audio cassettes, drug store preparations, correspondence courses, and so forth. Almost all self-care efforts and aids involve some cognitive techniques. In fact, those who successfully quit on their own have higher levels of success expectancy and self-efficacy (areas strongly affected by cognitive interventions) than those who are unsuccess­ ful. Approximately 16%-20% of smokers who quit on their own are abstinent at 1 year (Schwartz, 1987). For those who wish to receive assistance with smoking cessation, there are nonprofit and commercial clinics and groups available. Most of these utilize cognitive methods, including education, self-monitor­ ing, and modifying attitudes about smoking. In a review of 46 group smoking cessation programs, Schwartz (1987) found median cessation rates ranging from 2 1 % to 36%, depending on the length of follow- up and the time the study was conducted. A number of medications have also been tried as aids to smok­ ing cessation over the years. These have included lobeline, mepro- bamate, amphetamines, anticholinergics, sedatives, tranquilizers, sym­ pathomimetics, anticonvulsants, buspirone, propranolol, clonidine, nicotine polacrilex, and most recently transdermal nicotine. Of these, the most promising medications have been those that replace the nicotine from cigarettes with prescription nicotine (i.e., nicotine gum and transdermal nicotine). In fact, the median cessation rates for nico­ tine gum at 6-month and 1-year follow-ups were 2 3 % and 11%. These rates were substantially higher when the gum was used in conjunc­ tion with cognitive-behavioral smoking cessation programs: 3 5 % and 2 9 % (Schwartz, 1987). At the time this book was being written, transdermal nicotine delivery systems had just been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Hence, substantial field trials of these \"patches\" have not been conducted. Both hypnosis and acupuncture have been of interest to the gen­ eral public as smoking cessation techniques. However, empirical vali­ dation of these methods has been weak and hirther controlled studies are necessary prior to assuming their efficacy (Schwartz, 1987). SUMMARY Huge numbers of people in the United States are affected by substance abuse. Thousands of books and articles have been written and millions of dollars have been spent on research on the addictions. Nonetheless, there is a noticeable paucity of reliably effec- Overview 21 five substance abuse treatment strategies. For years, however, it h been noted that there are underlying cognitive processes common to the addictions. (Even Alcoholics Anonymous warns alcoholics about \"stinkin' thinkin.'\") W e believe strongly that understanding and work­ ing with these cognitive aspects more explicitly will help to resolve some of the uncertainty plaguing the field of substance use treatment. In the chapters that follow we strive for a high degree of speci­ ficity in describing the procedures that comprise this approach. A preliminary version of this book currently serves as a therapist manual in an ongoing National Institute on Drug Abuse pilot study compar­ ing cognitive therapy, supportive-expressive therapy, and general drug counseling treatment outcomes for cocaine abusers. Our hope is that Cognitive Therapy of Substance Abuse will continue to serve as a train­ ing guide for further clinical and empirical tests. C H A P T E R 2 C o g n i t i v e M o d e l o f A d d i c t i o n W R Y DO PEOPLE USE DRUGS (AND/OR ALCOHOL)? Some individuals are \"generalists\" and may use a wide variety of addictive substances almost randomly or depending on their availability. Others are \"specialists\" and their drug of choice may depend on its specific pharmacological properties as well as its social meanings (e.g., alcohol is often viewed as manly and associated with sports, whereas cocaine is associated with group acceptance and sexual activity). Cocaine may be used because of its stimulant properties- producing a rapid \"high,\" for example. Similarly, amphetamines may be chosen as psychic energizers. In contrast,\n",

      "barbiturates, benzodiaz­ epines, and alcohol may be preferred because of their relaxing effect and, perhaps, their presumed relief of inhibitions. Hallucinogens are attractive to some to relieve boredom and \"expand consciousness.\" Most people addicted to cocaine have also abused other drugs and/or alcohol (N. S. Miller, 1991; Regier et al., 1990; Stimmel, 1991). There are numerous explanations for why people use—and become addicted to-psychotropic substances. In general, the process of addiction can be understood in terms of a few simple, perhaps obvious, formulas. A basic reason for starting on drugs or alcohol is to get pleasure, to experience the exhilaration of being high, and to share the excitement with one's companions who are also using (Stim­ mel, 1991). Further, there is the expectation that the drug cocaine, for example, will increase efficiency, improve fluency, and enhance creativity. 22 Cognitive Model of Addiction 23 How do people progress from recreational or casual use to regu­ lar use? In time, additional factors may contribute to becoming depen­ dent on the drug. Some people find that drug taking-for example, heroin, benzodiazepines (such as Valium), or barbiturates^rovides temporary relief from anxiety, tension, sadness, or boredom. These individuals soon develop the belief that they can weather the frustra­ tions and stresses of life better if they can turn to drugs and/or alco­ hol for a period of escape or oblivion. People with adverse life cir­ cumstances are more likely to become addicted than are those with more sources of satisfaction (Peele, 1985). For a while, real-life prob­ lems fade into insignificance and life itself seems more attractive. As one patient put it, \"If I take coke, m y bad thoughts go away.\" Fur­ ther, people whose self-confidence is low may find that the drug or alcohol boosts their morale—in the short run. Finally, many individu­ als discover that using drugs provides new social groups in which the only requirement for admission and acceptance is that they are users. If drug using has so many advantages, why should we be con­ cerned with getting people off the \"drug habit\"? The profound impli­ cations of breaking the law by using illegal drugs (and selling them in order to support their habit) are so obvious that they do not need further elaboration. Regardless of whether the drugs are legal, such as alcohol, or illegal, substance abuse creates serious personal, social, and medical problems (Frances & Miller, 1991; Kosten & Kleber, 1992). A major problem is that the drug seems to take control of addicted individuals. Their goals, values, and attachments become subordinate to the drug using. They cannot manage their lives effectively. They become subject to a vicious cycle of craving, precipitous drops in mood, and greater distress that can be relieved immediately only by using drugs again. The web of external and internal problems leading to and, later, maintaining compulsive drug use is a defining characteristic of addic­ tion. Far from soothing life's pains, the drugs create a new set of prob­ lems-enormous financial outiays (for illegal drugs), threat of or achial loss of employment, and difficulties in important personal relation­ ships, such as marriage. The individual also becomes stigmatized by society-as a \"lush\" or a \"junkie.\" Finally, of course, chronic use may cause serious medical problems and even death. As pointed out by Peele (1989), the compulsive use of psycho­ tropic agents depends on a wide variety of personal and social fac­ tors. If the environment is malevolent and there is group support for drug use-as in the case of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam-widespread drug use is more likely. W h e n the environment is comparatively less stress­ ful (as when veterans retiirn to civilian life), individuals do not con- 24 COGNITIVE THERAPY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE tinue excessive use—except for those who had been heavy users prio to military service (Robins, Davis, & Goodwin, 1974). A number of characteristics distinguish addicted individuals from casual users. A major difference, as pointed out by Peele (1985), is that while addicted individuals subordinate important values to drug using, casual users prize other values more highly: family, friends, occupation, recreation, and economic security, to name a few. In addition, drug users may have certain characteristics, such as low frus­ tration tolerance, nonassertiveness, or poor impulse control, that make them more susceptible. Thus, psychological and social factors may be the determinative factors—rather than the pharmacological prop­ erties per se—in converting a drug user into a drug abuser. Support­ ing this hypothesis is the commonly encountered phenomenon in hospital settings where \"patients who take opioids for acute pain or cancer pain rarely experience euphoria and even more rarely develop psychic dependence or addiction to the mood-altering effects of nar­ cotics\" {Medical Letter on Drugs and Therapeutics, 1993, p. 5). If drug addiction were merely a biological process, we would not expect this to be the case. The sequence of using or drinking is illustrated in Figure 2.1. An addicted individual who is feeling anxious or low decides to have a smoke or a snort. The short-term relief is followed by delayed, longer- term negative consequences: problems about breaking the law, seri­ ous financial problems, family difficulties, and possibly medical prob­ lems. These problems lead to realistic fears of being apprehended, becoming bankrupt, losing a job, disrupting close relationships, and becoming ill. These fears generate more anxiety and lead to craving and further using or drinking to neutralize the anxiety. Thus, a vicious cycle is established. Many other kinds of vicious cycles, which are described in Chap­ ter 3 (this volume), may be created. These involve a number of psy­ chological factors such as low self-esteem, emotional distress, and hopelessness. W H Y NOT STOP IF DRUGS OR ALCOHOL CREATE PROBLEMS? By definition, addicts are people who have difficulty in stopping permanently. They may have started to use voluntarily, but they either do not believe that they can stop or they do not choose to stop voluntarily. At the first sign of medical, financial, or interper­ sonal problems, many users ignore, minimize, or deny the problems Cognitive Model of Addiction 25 Anxiety/Low Mood Using ^k- Flnanclal, Social, Medical Problems FIGURE 2.1. Simple model of vicious cycle. or attribute them to something other than drugs (e.g., they m a y blame their spouse for domestic problems). Others m a y be aware of the problems, but they evaluate the advantages of using as greater than the disadvantages. M u c h of this evaluation is based on avoiding a true assessment of the disadvantages (Gawin & EUinwood, 1988; Gawin & Kleber, 1988). As the problems increase, m a n y users become more ambivalent and begin to vacillate in their decision to use. One factor in maintaining drug use is the c o m m o n belief that withdrawing from the drug will produce intolerable side effects (Horvath, 1988, in press). However, these effects vary enormously from person to person—and from substance to substance—and the impact is greatly enhanced by the psychological meaning attached to the withdrawal symptoms. These meanings are often more salient than the actual adverse physiological sensations in determining the inten­ sity of withdrawal symptoms. Most cocaine abusers participating in detoxification programs, for example, feel better in the early stages after they stop using (Ziedonis, 1992). A major obstacle to eliminating using or drinking is the network of dysfunctional beliefs that center around the drugs or alcohol. Exam­ ples of these beliefs are: \"I can't be happy unless I can use,\" and \"I a m more in control w h e n I've had a few drinks.\" A n individual w h o is contemplating eliminating the use of drugs or alcohol m a y feel sad or anxious. Termination of reliance on drugs or alcohol is seen as a deprivation of satisfaction and solace or a threat to well-being and functioning Qennings, 1991). Stopping m a y mean, for some, remov­ ing the \"security blanket\" used to cushion dysphoria. Addicted individuals often try on their o w n to stop using or drink­ ing. However, w h e n they experience the craving (often stimulated by low m o o d or exposure to the drugs or related stimuli), they feel dis­ appointed if they restrain themselves from using or drinking. They perceive their feelings of disappointment and distress as intolerable; the thought, \"1 can't stand this feeling,\" upsets them even more. Hence, they feel driven to yield to the craving in order to dispel the 26 COGNITFVE THERAPY OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE sense of loss and relieve their distress. Patients often have a cl of beliefs that seem to become stronger when they decide to stop using. These center around the anticipated deprivation: \"If I can't use, I won't be able to bear the pain (or boredom),\" \"There is nothing left in life for me,\" \"I will be unhappy\", or \"1 will lose m y friends.\" These beliefs are elaborated more in the section on low frustration toler­ ance (Chapter 15, this volume). Another set of beliefs centers around the addicted individual's sense of helplessness in controlling the craving: \"The craving is too strong,\" \"1 don't have the power to stop,\" or \"Even if I do stop—1 will only start up again.\" These beliefs become self-fulfilling prophecies. Since the patients believe they are incapable of controlling their urges, they are less likely to try to control them and, thus, confirm their belief in their helplessness in overcoming their addiction. W H Y D O PEOPLE W A N T HELP? There are roughly five stages people go through in seeking help (Prochaska et al., 1992). In the precontemplative stage, they do not even acknowledge to themselves that they have a problem (or else they consider using more important than the problems it causes). In the contemplative stage, they are willing to consider their problems, but are still unlikely to stop using on their own. Individuals in the preparation stage intend to take action to cease their drug and alcohol use, but are uncertain about being able to follow through. In the action stage, patients behaviorally demonstrate a decrease in their drug-taking behaviors and a therapeutic modification in their drug-taking beliefs. Those who are successful enough to reach the maintenance stage have already taken great strides toward a drug-free and alcohol-free life, and are actively working to maintain consistency in this endeavor over a period of months and years. People come to therapy for a variety of reasons. Some users have been arrested for \"dealing\" or possession and are referred by the courts. Others see their lives deteriorating as a result of the financial, psychological, and interpersonal consequences of using or drinking. Still others are pressured by friends or family. By the time these patients are labeled drug abusers, addicts, or alcoholics, they have often hit a low point in terms of any combination of the following: health, social adjustment, employment and economic status, and psychologi­ cal well-being. Many people with drug and alcohol problems have tried repeat­ edly to \"break the habit,\" only to relapse eventually. Others suffer from Cognitive Model of Addiction 27 a personality disorder (e.g., Mirin & Weiss, 1991; Nace, Davis, & Gaspari, 1991; Regier et al., 1990) and/or a psychiatric syndrome such as chronic anxiety (e.g., Kranzler & Liebowitz, 1988; LaBounty, Hat- sukami, Morgan, & Nelson, 1992; Walfish, Massey, & Krone, 1990) or depression (e.g., Hatsukami & Pickens, 1982; Rounsaville & Kleber, 1986). For some, drug use is simply a manifestation of their mani­ fold difficulties. For others, drugs represent a form of self-medication (Castaneda, Galanter, & Franco, 1989; Khantzian, 1985) to relieve their feelings of distress, sadness, or anxiety. Given the consequences of sustained drug use, it is important to consider the problem in terms of its sociological, interpersonal, and psychological dimensions, in addition to the strictly pharmacologi­ cal properties of drugs. In fact, substance abuse or addiction could be defined as compulsive use leading to a web of entanglement involv­ ing social, economic, and legal problems over which the patient no longer has control. Given their acknowledgment that they are addicted, many of these individuals come to the conclusion that the only way they can manage or even salvage their lives is to receive assistance, professional or otherwise.
